FRONT-END:

How to run the application locally:

  1. Make sure to move into the client directory.
  2. Make sure you have a modern NodeJS version (20 or above).
  3. Open a terminal and run `npm install`.
  4. Open a terminal and run `npm run dev`.


BACK-END:

How to run the application locally:
  1. Make sure to move into the api directory.
  2. Open a terminal and run `npm install`.
  3. Open a terminal and run `node ./index.js`. (Not a big fan of start scripts for personal projects.).
  4. The application is using Express + MongoDB for the backend. There is a dummy info to be seeded into the db initially,
    if the 'Photo' document is empty.
  5. Tools such as MongoDB Compass could be used for exploring the db.
